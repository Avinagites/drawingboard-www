	<p>This Privacy Policy sets out how Drawingboardevents.com.sg utilise and protect the information we collect from you; including the personal and non-personal information that you provide us with consent, also covering those that you provide voluntarily or that which we collect in accordance with the procedures associated with the use of our website. An individual is deemed to consent to the collection, use or disclosure of personal data by an organisation for a purpose if the individual voluntarily provides the personal data to the organisation for that purpose; and it is reasonable that he or she would do so (PDPC Singapore).<br>

	  Consent can be obtained in a number of different ways. As a best practice, an organisation should obtain consent that is in writing or recorded in a manner that is accessible for future reference, for example, if the organisation is required to prove that it had obtained consent.

For such situations, it would be prudent for the organisation to document the consent in some way (PDPC Singapore).<br>
