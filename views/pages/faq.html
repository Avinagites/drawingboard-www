        <h4>What is Drawing Board Events?</h4>
        <p>Drawing Board Events was established to provide a one stop shop resource to anyone wanting to plan their own event or party here in Singapore. Our innovative, proprietary Drawing Board tool (see “What is my Drawing Board tool and how do I use it?” below) was created after extensive market research and development, and is the first of its kind here in Singapore!</p>

        <h4>What is my Drawing Board tool and how do I use it?</h4>
        <p>Our innovative Drawing Board tool does two things – It provides an extensive, user-reviewed database of business services catering to anyone looking to plan an event or party. From Venues to Novelty Services, we’ve compiled a list so comprehensive, you won’t need to go anywhere else!</p>
        <p>In browsing our database, you will notice a “Request Quote” button on every vendor’s profile page. It’s hard to miss and this is where the ingenuity of your Drawing Board tool sets us apart from other party planning websites!</p>
        <p>Clicking on “Request Quote” will add the chosen vendor to a list, alongside any other vendor you would like to receive a quote or information from. Once you’re satisfied with the list of vendors you’ve chosen, simply take a couple minutes to complete an eform we’ve designed. This list of Vendors will then be notified of your quote or information request so all you have to do is relax and let them respond to you! No more wasting time contacting each vendor separately and having to explain your situation over and over again!

        <h4>Do I need to pay to use Drawing Board Events?</h4>
        <p>Absolutely not! Your Drawing Board tool, including all the resources available to you on the entire website, is completely FREE to use.</p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Is Drawing Board Events an event planning company?</h4>
        <p>No. Drawing Board Events is purely an online directory for business services, or vendors, catering to anyone looking to plan an event or party. Whilst we feature and advertise these vendors, we do not receive commissions.</p>
        <p>
        In deciding which vendors to go with, why not utilise the hundreds of reviews generated by customers just like yourself! Completely unbiased and unsolicited, our review and rating system is a great way to sift through our extensive database to find that perfect vendor that will make your next event a smashing success!
